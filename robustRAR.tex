  \note{These are slides for a talk I will give on 30 Oct 2014, at a
    symposium on scholarly publishing.

    I'm a statistician. My research focuses on genetics, and
    most of my papers are in genetics journals.

    So in commenting on open access, I'm focusing on scientific
    publications, and perhaps more narrowly, on the biological

\section{Introduction to RAR}

\begin{frame}{What is a Response Adaptive Randomization (RAR) Design?}

\bi
\itemsep6pt
\item RAR designs utilize accumulating information on outcomes as the trial progresses in order to alter the treatment assignment probabilities and assign more patients to the better-performing treatment arm.
\item Previous outcomes are used to tilt the randomization probabilities in favor of the treatment currently observed to have superior results.
\item \onslide<2->{{\color<2->{vhilight} The trial needs to be short to be able to obtain the outcome of the trial for future randomization}}
\ei
    
\end{frame}


\section{Time-Trends in Clinical Trials and How it affects RAR?}

\begin{frame}{What is the issue with RAR?}
Peto (1985): \\
“ . . . patients entering a trial are often not uniform in prognosis.  For example, both in the European Coronary Bypass Trial and in the Medical Research Council’s 8th Acute Myeloid Leukaemia Trial {\color{vhilight} there was a statistically significant trend} towards better prognosis as time went by.  If, therefore, there had also been a trend in allocation proportions towards the apparently better treatment, an appreciable bias might have been engendered.”

{\color{hilight} Time- Trends in Clinical Trials!}

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Why Time-trends are Common?}

\vspace{12pt}
\bi
\itemsep18pt
\item {Centers can change, such as when VAs enter the trial earlier or later than academic institutions.}
\item \onslide<2->{Patients within centers can change, especially but not only with chronic diseases, due to the phenomenon of “A queue of desperate patients lining up at the door”.}
\item \onslide<3->{In addition to these examples, an investigator who wants to game the system could cross his/her fingers that his favored treatment arm is ahead, then progressively enroll better prognosis patients over time.}
\ei

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Time-trends in RAR}

\bi

\item Thall et al. (2015) investigated type-I error under a {\color{hilight} linear time-trend induced} in the traditional response-adaptive randomization design and showed that the type-I error is significantly above the nominal level.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Simulation Setup}
\vspace{12pt}
\bi
\itemsep12pt
\item $N$ = 200 subjects  
\item $K$ = 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 100, 200. 
\item 10,000 independent simulations were performed 
\item $p_A$ is set to 0.25, $p_B$ is set to 0.25 (null case), 0.45.
\item Run-in period of 20 patients (fixed randomization).
\item Allocation probability bounded between 0.2 and 0.8.
\ei
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Simulation Setup}
\vspace{12pt}
To examine the effects of time-trends, we increased both $p_A$ and $p_B$ linearly from their initial values to a final value of 0.25 larger. 
\bi
\itemsep12pt
\item $p_A(n) = 0.25 + 0.25(n / N)$, where $n$ is the patient that have been accrued and $N$ is the total sample size. 
\item for null case, $p_B(n) = 0.25 + 0.25(n / N)$.
\item for alternative case, $p_B(n) = 0.45 + 0.25(n / N)$.
\ei
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Simulation Setup: Bayesian Design}
\bi
\itemsep12pt
\item The probability of randomizing subjects to treatment A in stratum j, $\pi_{j, A}$ is defined as
$$\pi_{j, A} = \frac{(p_{A>B, j - 1} (data))^ {n/2N}}{(p_{A>B, j - 1} (data))^ {n/2N} + (p_{B>A, j - 1} (data))^ {n/2N}},$$
where $p_{A > B, j - 1}(data)$ is the posterior probability that treatment A has a higher success rate than  treatment B, $p_{A>B, j - 1} (data)) = 1 - p_{B>A, j - 1} (data))$ after the $j - 1 ^{st}$ block, $n$ is the number of accrued patients and $N$ is the maximum sample size. . 
\item Beta-binomial conjugate prior is used with $\mathcal{B}eta(0.5, 0.5)$ priors.
\ei
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Simulation Setup: Bayesian Design}
\bi
\itemsep12pt
\item If treatment B is selected to be better than treatment A, then if $P_{B > A}(data) > .99$, the trial is stopped early for success and if $P_{B>A}(data) < .01$, the trial is stopped early for failure. 
\item For non-stratified design, where $K$ = 1, 200, if the final posterior probability $P_{B > A}(data) > .95$, then treatment B is declared superior to treatment A. 
\item For stratified design by block, Bayesian logistic regression was implemented to estimate the posterior probability of treatment difference and block effects. 
\ei

\begin{frame}{Discussion}
\bi
\itemsep12pt
\item Blocks with a large number of patients also help reduce the large probability of imbalance in the wrong direction, where more patients are assigned to the inferior treatment compared to traditional RAR. 
\item Blocks with fewer patients can reduce the power of the trial because if patients are not randomized to both treatments in a block, the block becomes uninformative. 
\item Small number of blocks (K = 2, 4 and 5) has a good tradeoff between efficiency and ethically treating patients to the best known superior treatment.
\ei
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Discussion}
\bi
\itemsep12pt
\item Large number of blocks should be clearly avoided for both ethical reason and poor design.
\item Statisticians need to be careful with issues of time-trend and methods to alter the randomization ratio.
\item Time-trend can significantly impact the type-I error rate.
\item R package \textbf{blockRAR}

%\note{We need to send our best work to open access journals.
%
%We need to find ways to support our junior colleagues, so that they
%may do so as well.
%
%We need to evaluate people based on their work and not by the name of
%the journal in which it appeared. We all may say, ``Science and
%Nature are often crap and there are lots of fantastic papers that
%appear elsewhere.'' But somehow when we see Nature or Cell on
%someone's CV, we still have an immediate, positive reaction.
%
%I would like to see endowed journals, open forever.
%
%The quickest way to free the product of federally funded research
%would be to reform copyright law. If the product of our research were
%forced open by law, the publishing industry would figure out how to
%pay for it in short order.
%
%But given the state of politics in the US, I'm not too optimistic
%about that.
